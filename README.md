# User Registration & Login in JWT

1. It is node & express application which uses the cloud database provided by MongoDB named MongoDB Atlas. Local instance of MongoDB can be used also.
2. It shows registration and login of an user with JWT authentication along with required validations.
3. Passport-JWT and custom JWT both verification is implemented.
4. Two protected routes are implemented which can be accessed if the user is authenticated. One route is custom JWT authenticated and another route is passport-JWT authenticated.
5. JWT is generated at register route so that, if the user successfully registers, can immediately be logged in. And, JWT generation at login route is self-explanatory.
